				<h2>Home</h2>
				<p>Hi, I'm Lorenzo De Sisto , a computer science engineering student  at CESI . My passion  for technology  started at a young age and has only grown stronger as I've delved deeper into the field. From programming languages  like c# and Python to software development and data structures , I've been exploring every facet of computer science. In my spare time,  I love to work on personal projects like building websites  and creating mobile applications. My ultimate goal is to use my skills to make a positive impact on society, whether that's through developing cutting-edge software  or finding innovative solutions to real-world problems. I'm always looking for new challenges  and opportunities to learn, so I'm excited to see where my career in computer science  will take me.

This project served as a significant milestone in my educational journey, as it allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge I had acquired and put it into practice in a real-world context. One of the most notable aspects of the project was the emphasis on CESI&#x2019;s active pedagogy. This educational approach, characterized by its hands-on nature and experiential learning, played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding of the subject matter. Rather than passively absorbing information through traditional lectures and textbooks, I was actively engaged in the project, collaborating with my peers, and grappling with real challenges.Through the Admin Si Project, I was able to enhance my problem-solving skills and develop a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in administering information systems. The project presented me with the opportunity to tackle complex tasks such as system configuration, software installation, and network management. By actively working on these assignments, I not only gained technical expertise but also learned how to navigate the practical challenges that often arise in the field.')">

EasySave is the name of a utility application developed in a team, designed for file and folder backup. It features a bilingual version (French-English) and incorporates daily log management in both XML and JSON formats.During the block, our team delved into the intricacies of the EasySave project. We worked collaboratively to develop an efficient and user-friendly utility application that enables users to safeguard their files and folders. The application boasts a bilingual interface, allowing users to seamlessly switch between French and English languages based on their preferences.One of the notable aspects of the project was the implementation of daily log management. We incorporated XML and JSON formats to capture and store relevant information about the backup process. This feature not only provides users with a comprehensive log of their backup activities but also facilitates easy analysis and retrieval of data when required.')">

The goal of the project is the management and automation of the provided medical database, extracting information and presenting it in schemas and diagrams, followed by interpretation of the gathered data. The BigData block focused on handling a complex medical database and leveraging its data for meaningful insights. Our objective was to create an automated system that efficiently manages the database, extracting valuable information and representing it visually through schemas and diagrams.During the project, we utilized various data processing and visualization techniques to transform the raw medical data into comprehensive representations. This involved implementing algorithms to extract relevant information from the database and presenting it in structured schemas and graphical diagrams. These visual representations served as effective tools for analyzing and interpreting the data, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions and make informed decisions.')">

It focuses on the Traveling Salesman Problem, complexities, and graphs. The aim of the project is to provide a delivery algorithm that optimizes the route, making it more cost-effective and efficient. The Advanced Algorithmics block delves into the challenging problem of the Traveling Salesman, which involves finding the shortest route to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting point. We explore various algorithms and strategies to tackle this problem, aiming to develop an efficient solution that minimizes travel costs and maximizes time savings.Throughout the project, we analyze the complexities associated with solving the Traveling Salesman Problem and gain a deeper understanding of graph theory. We investigate different graph representations and algorithms, considering factors such as distance, time, and other constraints to devise an optimized delivery algorithm.The main objective of the project is to provide a robust algorithm that optimizes the delivery route, making it more economical and faster. By leveraging advanced algorithmic techniques, we aim to minimize travel distances, reduce transportation costs, and enhance overall delivery efficiency.')">

Our team, consisting of Emmanuel, Hugo, Mathieu, and myself, is dedicated to creating a user-friendly interface that provides access to the official monster list. Users will be able to view detailed information about selected monsters and utilize filters based on monster type and Challenge Rating (CR) for refined searches. Throughout the project, I have utilized my expertise in file parsing and data translation, while also working on the overall interface and monster details functionality. Emmanuel has focused on enhancing the application visual aspects and finalizing the monster details functionality, while Mathieu has played a key role in implementing the listing of monsters from XML files and incorporating type and CR filters. We are confident that this application, with its simplicity and efficiency, will be highly appreciated by the Dungeons and Dragons community. We remain committed to delivering a professional and polished application that meets the expectations of players.
